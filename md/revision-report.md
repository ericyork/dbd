Completely rebuilt the interface, including the navigation, to support the reorganization of the webtext and to better integrate the examples of dark patterns throughout the pages.

Deleted approximate 5k words and replaced another 4k+ with newly written text. Mainly the changes involved removing large sections of theory so readers could better focus on the dark patterns. 

Added citations to the Jarrett and Noble texts recommended by Dr. Doan, but much more than this, significantly expanded the sections of the argument concerned with queer and feminist rhetorics. For example, I added many paragraphs of discussion on Janet Atwill’s feminist reclamation project *Rhetoric Reclaimed,* as well as on Jay Dolmage’s feminist-queer formulation of *Disability Rhetoric* to better reflect their role in the argument and feature their contributions more prominently.

I also added significant new sections on recent contributions made by Erin Brock Carlson in technofeminist rhetorics and Angie Mallory in Rhetorical Operations. In general, I consolidated and made significant updates to the lit review section, bringing in a few sources from the recent Rodolfo & Hart-Davidson collection on RhetOps, especially the two that discuss dark patterns directly, as well as a few other major new works.

I made sure each section ran into and out of the next and proceeding sections by adding paragraphs to form transitions, but in general the argument is much, much more linear  in its newer form anyhow.

I removed all Twitter dependencies and replaced all examples with static files and plain hyperlinks pointing to the post on Twitter. (And they all have extensive alt text, as well.) All images are included in the project directory.

Added an updated References section, at the end of the Conclusion, that uses the modified format.

These were the major changes, but I made numerous small fixes as well.
